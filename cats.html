<h2>This is Oreo.</h2>
<img title="It's another cat!" src="images/Oreo.png" alt="It's another cat" width="400" height="400">
<p> Oreo is the newest addition to our family. He is almost a year old, so he's still a kitten</p>
<p> His hobbies include meowing for food, meowing for attention, and clawing at Solo.</p>

<h2> Why, cats?</h2>
<ul>
  <li> They are soft and snuggly</li>
  <li> They are affectionate but not needy</li>
  <li> Easy to clean after</li>
</ul>
