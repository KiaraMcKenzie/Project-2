<h1>My trip at Barcelona, Spain!</h1>

<h2>Main Buildings</h2>
<img title="Santa Maria del Mar" src="images/Del_Mar.jpg" alt="Santa Maria del Mar" width="800" height="500">
<p> One of the many churches in Barcelona. Dedicated to Saint Mary, known as the mother of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p> It is very beautiful. One of the best examples of Catalan Gothic architecture. </p>



<img title="La Sagrada Familia" src="images/Sagrada.png" alt="La Sagrada Familia">
<p> This building is frightening. This picture alone does not do it justice because it is so overwhelming and powerful.</p>
<p> Designed by the famous Antoni Gaudi. It had numerous bibical depictions and it is still being built.</p>
<p> This building has been in construction for over a hundred years, that's how huge it is!"</p>
